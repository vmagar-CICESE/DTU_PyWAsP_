For this location we will generate site effectes and predicted wind climate over a uniform grid.\n",

    "The listed objects can be imported as `pywasp` `xarray` datasets by calling specifing `geter` methods and suppling  the desired object `id` and depending on the object type also some additional parameters. First thing to notice is that we have two ids assigned to vector map objects. These two vector maps are identical.  The reason why there two ids/ two maps is that each id tells `WAsP` to read the vector map differently, one as an `elevation` map while the second as a `roughness` map. As you will see later in this tutorial we do this a bit different in `pywasp` comparing to `WAsP` GUI. \n",
